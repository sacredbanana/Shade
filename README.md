# Shader

## What's this?
This is a OpenGL GLSL shader viewer compatible with shaders written for Bonzomatic by Gargaj, which is a program where you can write a 2D fragment/pixel shader while it is running in the background. Bear in mind FFT is not currently supported so don't expect your shaders to dance to the music.

## Building
* Install and set up devkitPro
* Run `(sudo) (dkp-)pacman -S libnx switch-mesa switch-glad` to install the required libraries
* Run `make` to compile and build
* Transfer `Shader.nro` to your Switch
* (optional) 
Enjoy
